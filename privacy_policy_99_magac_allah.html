    <h1>Privacy Policy for "99 Names of Allah"</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 19, 2025</p>

    <p>This privacy policy explains how information is handled in our mobile application, "99 Names of Allah".</p>

    <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy: We Collect No Personal Data</h2>
    <p><strong>The "99 Names of Allah" app does not collect, store, or share any personal information from its users.</strong> We do not ask for your name, email, location, or any other personally identifiable information. Your use of this app is anonymous.</p>

    <h2>Data Handled by Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>To be fully transparent and to comply with Google Play policies, we must inform you about the anonymous data handled by the third-party services that our app uses to function and remain free.</p>
    
    <p>The services we use are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advertising (Google AdMob)</h3>
    <p>To keep the app free for everyone, we show ads through Google AdMob. Google's ad service uses your device's unique, resettable "Advertising ID" to show you more relevant ads. We, the developers of this app, do not have access to this ID or any information linked to it. This process is handled entirely by Google.</p>
    <p>For more information on how Google uses data for advertising, please visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">Google's ad policy</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Analytics and Crash Reporting (Google Play Services)</h3>
    <p>To ensure the app is stable and to fix bugs, Google Play Services may automatically collect anonymous data if the app crashes. This "Log Data" includes non-personal information like your device type, operating system version, and the time of the error. This information is not linked to your identity and is only used to improve the app for all users.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We are committed to ensuring that our app is secure. However, as we do not collect your personal data, the primary security of your data with third-party services lies with them. We trust Google's robust security measures to protect the anonymous data they handle.</p>

    <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our service is not directed at anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Any changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
